            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <p><b>For the layers:</b></p>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <p><b>Optional:</b></p>

            <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <p><b>Step 1: Prepare the Meat Sauce</b></p>
            <li><b>Brown the Ground Beef:</b> In a large skillet or pot, cook the ground beef over medium-high heat
            until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks.</li>
            <li><b>Add Aromatics:</b> Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet with the beef. Cook for about
            5 minutes, until the onion is softened and translucent.</li>
            <li><b>Combine Ingredients:</b> Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, water, sugar, basil, fennel
            seeds, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Let it
            simmer uncovered for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in chopped fresh parsley towards the end.
            Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <p><b>Step 2: Prepare the Cheese Mixture</b></p>
            <li><b>Mix Ricotta Cheese:</b> In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, salt, and chopped parsley. Mix until smooth 
            and well combined. Set aside.</li>
        <p><b>Step 3: Cook the Lasagna Noodles</b></p>
            <li><b>Boil Noodles:</b> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions
            until al dente (firm but tender). Drain and rinse with cold water to prevent sticking.</li>
        <p><b>Step 4: Assemble the Lasagna</b></p>
            <li><b>Preheat Oven:</b> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li><b>Layering:</b> Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 4 lasagna noodles over the sauce,
            slightly overlapping them.</li>
            <li><b>Layer Cheese and Sauce:</b> Spread a third of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Top with a third of the meat sauce and
            sprinkle with a third of the shredded mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li><b>Repeat Layers:</b> Repeat the layers twice more, starting with noodles, then ricotta mixture, meat sauce, and cheeses.</li>
        <p><b>Step 5: Bake the Lasagna</b></p>
            <li><b>Cover and Bake:</b> Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, tenting it slightly to prevent the cheese from sticking. Bake in the preheated
            oven for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li><b>Uncover and Bake:</b> Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.</li>
        <p><b>Step 6: Rest and Serve</b></p>
            <li><b>Rest:</b> Let the lasagna rest for about 15 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the layers to set and makes it easier to cut into neat portions.</li>
            <li><b>Garnish and Serve:</b> Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
